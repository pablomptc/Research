During the recent years, the use of social media has become a popular way of
establish and maintain social interaction and relationships. For those networks
based on geolocation (LBSN), their link to the urban environment and physical
space offer great possibilities in regards to the observation, research and
description of such. This paper uses public data from Wapo, a location-based 
social network utilized by male homosexual users. A new methodology will be 
proposed, which aims to update Gates' gay index by focusing on the density of
users and the profile pictures. These app usage data will be cross-referenced
with objective static data indicators related to demography, and socioeconomic
data to observe correspondences. Thus this paper utilizes indicators extracted
from Wapo as and alternative and complementary methodology to observe the 
distribution of creative areas under certain conditions. It is established a
theoretical link between inequality and the feeling of comfort regarding the 
perception of tolerance. This relation is experimented through the content 
observation of profile pictures within the app and the quantitative proportion
of explicit displays of identity. It is observed that density of users remains
independent from any socioeconomic indicator. However, mathematical discordances 
found in the tendencies about the amount of active users and the proportion of
explicit profile pictures finds correspondence with areas known as creative and
gay-friendly and potential gentrification.
